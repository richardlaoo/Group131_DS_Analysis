    "When it comes to dealing with ethics for our project, there may be potential region bias in the data available since it may be the case that there are missing regions that are underrepresented in the available government datasets listed above. Additionally, since we are mostly sampling from local government datasets there may be bias as we are not including other datasets that aren't federal which may pose as a confounding variable as not all crime, homelessness, and unemployment may be accounted for if not reported to the government. Though a confounding variable, the data collected from websites such as openjustice.doj.ca.gov permits the public usage of the data from their webiste, noting that their website public data is made sure to not include personal information of minors and or use copyrighted material. Addtionally, the data that we plan on scraping from census.gov already has personal identifying information removed and is publicly available for use as well, protecting personal privacy. Furthermore, there may be bias in our statistical analyses when it comes to looking at the rate of crime rate for a specific high income cities which can bias our interpretations of the data. Addtionally, we are focusing our analyses on San Diego County which can potentially be more expensive of a county to live in compared to other counties in California. Additionally, counties like San Diego will have different economies which can potentially skew our analyses as San Diego may not be able to provide enough economic diversity to tailor to all counties in California. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "To address these issues, we will explore what missing regions there are in the datasets and why they are underrepresented. That way, we can transparently report these reasons as factors that can impact our intrepretation when we analyze our data. For instance, findings that indicate a strong relationship between our variables and crime rate may not be applicable to rural areas. Furthermore, regarding data collections, data regarding crime, homelessness, and umemployment are tracked by the government, but this is something out of our scope of responsibilities. Instead, we can acknowledge that a false negative may be consistent with this underrepresentation when interpreting the relationship between our variables and crime. In this understanding, we may not be able to say for certain that findings of 'no relationship' is true. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our aim for this project is to find a more accurate measure for region's well-being, i.e. environment and economic factors may be considered, and how we can use this for a predictor model that can assist in assessing regions for their levels of crime. This project can be scaled for use in determining how the government can improve their allocation of resources to improve a region's well-being. However, because of bias in our project, our findings may only be applicable to regions similar to San Diego. That is, underrepresented regions should not be observed with our lens. Despite this bias, misuse or misinterpretation of our finding can be misleading and improperly measure a region's well-being. This can lead to reduction in select regions' aid from the government that can adversely affect them. "
