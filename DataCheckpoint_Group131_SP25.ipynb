    "* Our ideal dataset would be a dataset that includes measures for a region's GDP, environmental degradation, homelessness, and crime rates. While measures for GDP, homelessness, and crime rates are straightforward, environmental degradation is not as clear. Thus we can use tools provided by the state such as CalEnviroScreen 4.0 to act as measures for a region's environmental degradation. Unemployment data can be found from the California Employment Development Department, crime data from OpenJustice led by the California Department of Justice, and U.S. Census for some population data. Alternatively, we have information from San Diego for data regarding specific regions within San Diego county. This can be obtained directly from the San Diego County database. All of this data is available in usable forms (csv file, Microsoft Excel spreadsheet, etc.) through government websites. We would convert our files into pandas dataframes, which we would then merge into one dataframe that includes the data that we want. That is, the ideal dataset would be organized by it's observations of main regions in San Diego county, where the variables will be the region's income/capita, environmental degradation, homelessness, and crime rates. \n",

Our found environmental data isn't tracked by year so we need to search for a dataset that is. Our income data spans from 2012 to 2024 for all cities in San Diego county.
