    "* Our ideal dataset would be a dataset that includes measures for a region's GDP, environmental degradation, homelessness, and crime rates. While measures for GDP, homelessness, and crime rates are straightforward, environmental degradation is not as clear. Thus we can use tools provided by the state such as CalEnviroScreen 4.0 to act as measures for a region's environmental degradation. Unemployment data can be found from the California Employment Development Department, crime data from OpenJustice led by the California Department of Justice, and U.S. Census for some population data. Alternatively, we have information from San Diego for data regarding specific regions within San Diego county. This can be obtained directly from the San Diego County database. All of this data is available in usable forms (csv file, Microsoft Excel spreadsheet, etc.) through government websites. We would convert our files into pandas dataframes, which we would then merge into one dataframe that includes the data that we want. That is, the ideal dataset would be organized by it's observations of main regions in San Diego county, where the variables will be the region's income/capita, environmental degradation, homelessness, and crime rates. \n",

Our found environmental data isn't tracked by year so we need to search for a dataset that is. Our income data spans from 2012 to 2024 for all cities in San Diego county. Our unemployment data doesn't include specific cities in San Diego county so we need to find data that does. Our crime data accounts for all the cities wanted and spans 2009 to 2023.\n",

    "Additionally, there may be a confounding variable as not all crime and unemployment may be accounted for if not reported to the government. Though a confounding variable, the data collected from websites such as openjustice.doj.ca.gov permits the public usage of the data from their webiste, noting that their website public data is made sure to not include personal information of minors and or use copyrighted material. Furthermore, there may be bias in our statistical analyses when it comes to looking at the rate of crime rate for a specific high income cities which can bias our interpretations of the data. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "To address these issues, we will explore what missing counties there are in the datasets and why they are underrepresented. That way, we can transparently report these reasons as factors that can impact our intrepretation when we analyze our data. For instance, findings that indicate a strong relationship between our variables and crime rate may not be applicable to rural areas. Furthermore, regarding data collections, data regarding crime and umemployment are tracked by the government, but this is something out of our scope of responsibilities. Instead, we can acknowledge that a negative may be consistent with a 'false negative' because of the underrepresentation when interpreting the relationship between our variables and crime. In this understanding, we may not be able to say for certain that findings of 'no relationship' is true. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our aim for this project is to find a more accurate measure for county's well-being, i.e. environment and economic factors may be considered, and how we can use this for a predictor model that can assist in assessing counties for their levels of crime. This project can be scaled for use in determining how the government can improve their allocation of resources to improve a county's well-being. However, because of bias in our project, our findings may only be applicable to counties similar to San Diego. That is, underrepresented counties should not be observed with our lens. Despite this bias, misuse or misinterpretation of our finding can be misleading and improperly measure a county's well-being. This can lead to reduction in select counties' aid from the government that can adversely affect them. "
