    "    <p>Since the advent of the modern industrial city, crime rates in urban areas have been a consistent concern. By nature, cities are densely populated with a robust infrastructure and diverse economy, and tend to attract more people. With such a large population in a small area, it’s inevitable that crime will rise proportionally; however, underlying factors beyond industrialization are at play in these statistics. Many hold the sentiment that cities are less ideal places to settle due to factors like crime rate, population density, and homelessness while praising the large economies that seemingly contribute to these issues. Ultimately, cities have become an integral part of the globalized economy, serving as centers for trade and culture despite the negative connotations. Consequently, efforts to remedy these issues by identifying and addressing the root causes tend to go overlooked or rarely implemented. Economic health and overall quality of life are not mutually exclusive as many seem to believe. An in-depth analysis of the effects of the physical and social environment may provide insight into issues that require more allocation to reduce crime rates in the future. In studying these factors, establishing a new measure for economic health that is inclusive of issues that impact those living within cities can deviate focus away from simple measures like GDP, which only measure the gross economic output of a given region, and allow for more nuanced discussions on how to maximize economic returns while reducing the toll on average citizens.<p>\n",
    "    <p>The disproportionate amount of crime in urban areas is a topic that has been heavily explored by sociologists and economists alike. An article from the Journal of Political Economy, “Why is There More Crime in Cities?”,  compiled a number of different theories. They note that crime rates in cities outpace their rural counterparts even when accounting for the larger population. Some of the theories they posit suggest that dense city environments may cultivate less connected communities compared to smaller towns, decrease risk for criminals, or that those looking to profit from crime are likely to find it in economic centers. Ultimately, they found that crime reporting is underrepresented in cities, and the likelihood of arrest for a given crime is lower.<a name=\"#cite_note-1\">[1]</a> Regardless, it’s difficult to pinpoint any one cause, and the theories are merely speculation on the social implications on crime. As for the environment, much less research is evident. The council on Strategic Risks highlighted this issue; extreme weather events, higher temperatures, and social factors related to stresses based on climate have been linked to various forms of crime, especially violent crime. Some examples include gender-based violence against women increasing following adverse weather events and the likelihood of mass shooting events increasing in the summer months. The working theory is that changes in the environment may indirectly cause stresses that incentivize crime more by reducing the perceived risk for potential criminals.<a name=\"#cite_note-2\">[2]</a> Directly connecting a factor of climate change, like environmental degradation, may lend more credence to this issue being a factor in addressing crime in the future.<p>\n",
    "    <p>Along with changes in the climate, income inequality is a known factor in crime rates. Increasing fears over crime often go hand in hand with homelessness; as such, this phenomenon has been explored in the past. The Institute of Labor Economics studied this effect in California, finding that homeless rates and crime rates are linked, but how they are linked is interesting; high rates of homelessness increase the number of violent crimes, but not property crimes.<a name=\"cite_note-3\">[3]</a> Given this study was conducted at the state level, perhaps focusing on a single area may reaffirm or contradict this finding, depending on how a smaller, less diversified economy may have an effect. On the whole, while larger factors on crime rates appear to go overlooked, there have been some initiatives to address this disparity between economy, climate, inequality, and crime. Several states have implemented an alternate measure of economic health known as the genuine progress indicator, or GPI. This standard allows states to take into consideration non-economic factors like the environment and human health standards on the economy. According to the government of Maryland, this measure informs policymakers of economic progress without purely looking at the economic output, which may increase at the expense of its citizens.<a name=\"cite_note-4\">[4]</a> We believe that this approach is more progressive on these issues and may prove to benefit the economy and well being of individuals in unison, however, the fact that this model is only implemented in a few states as a policy informing measurement is insufficient. Finding a general link between these factors may reveal the true cost of these factors, and potentially allow us to devise another measurement that can be achieved using public data.<p>\n",

    "Our hypothesis is that there is a significant relationship with environmental degradation, high economic output, and homelessness that affects crime rates, and using these factors we can create a new measure of a city’s well being, as an alternate measure of economic health. Higher outputs of the economy attract higher rates of crime because of the high foot traffic in retail centers where businesses sell products and people are carrying valuables or money. Additionally, the stress of falling into homelessness and being homeless have individuals resorting to committing crimes as one of their survival options. As the environment continues to decline, this will also lead to higher crime rates and in particular violent crimes due to higher temperatures inflicting environmental stress on the population. All of these variables are high stressing factors in people’s lives, which ultimately dictate their wellbeing, safety, and future hence why when these variables are threatened in their lives, people will turn towards committing crimes in order to ensure their survival."

    "When it comes to dealing with ethics for our project, there may be potential county bias in the data available since it may be the case that there are missing counties that are underrepresented in the available government datasets listed above. That is, Lassen, Modoc, Sierra, and Yuba.\n",
    "Additionally, there may be a confounding variable as not all crime and unemployment may be accounted for if not reported to the government. Though a confounding variable, the data collected from websites such as openjustice.doj.ca.gov permits the public usage of the data from their webiste, noting that their website public data is made sure to not include personal information of minors and or use copyrighted material. Furthermore, there may be bias in our statistical analyses when it comes to looking at the rate of crime rate for a specific high income cities which can bias our interpretations of the data. Additionaly there may be bias in looking at the rate of Carbon Dioxide Gas emmisions in metric tons when looking at big counties in California. This may cause underepresented counties to not get the economic support from California to better their air quality when they most need it.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "To address these issues, we will explore what missing counties there are in the datasets and why they are underrepresented. That way, we can transparently report these reasons as factors that can impact our intrepretation when we analyze our data. For instance, findings that indicate a strong relationship between our variables and crime rate may not be applicable to rural areas. Furthermore, regarding data collections, data regarding crime and umemployment are tracked by the government, but this is something out of our scope of responsibilities. Instead, we can acknowledge that a negative may be consistent with a 'false negative' because of the underrepresentation when interpreting the relationship between our variables and crime. In this understanding, we may not be able to say for certain that findings of 'no relationship' is true. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our aim for this project is to find a more accurate measure for county's well-being, i.e. environment and economic factors may be considered, and how we can use this for a predictor model that can assist in assessing counties for their levels of crime. This project can be scaled for use in determining how the government can improve their allocation of resources to improve a county's well-being. However, because of bias in our project, our findings may only be applicable to counties similar to San Diego. That is, underrepresented counties should not be observed with our lens. Despite this bias, misuse or misinterpretation of our finding can be misleading and improperly measure a county's well-being. This can lead to reduction in select counties' aid from the government that can adversely affect them. Specifically when looking at funding for county police departments to combat crime or even funding for environmental initaitives to improve air quality in underepresented counties."
