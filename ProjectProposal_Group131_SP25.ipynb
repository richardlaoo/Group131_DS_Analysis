    "* Our ideal dataset would be a dataset that includes measures for a region's GDP, environmental degradation, homelessness, and crime rates. While measures for GDP, homelessness, and crime rates are straightforward, environmental degradation is not as clear. Thus we can use tools provided by the state such as CalEnviroScreen 4.0 to act as measures for a region's environmental degradation. Unemployment data can be found from the California Employment Development Department, crime data from OpenJustice led by the California Department of Justice, and U.S. Census for some population data. All of this data is availible in usable forms (csv file, Microsoft Excel spreadsheet, etc.) through government websites. We would convert our files into pandas dataframes, which we would then merge into one dataframe that includes the data that we want. That is, the ideal dataset would be organized by it's observations of each individual county in California, which would be 58, where the variables will be the region's GDP, environmental degradation, homelessness, and crime crates.\n",
